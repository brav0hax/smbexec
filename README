Written because we got sick of Metasploit PSExec getting popped

Special thanks to Carnal0wnage who's blog inspired us to go this route.

v1.1.1 - 11/11/2012
FIXED - Sometimes the IP validation fails even though it is a proper IP address
UPDATE - Installer updated with Samba-3.6.9 source
UPDATE - libesedb project moved to Google Code, installer updated with proper path  

Includes
- smbexec.sh
- installer.sh
- patches to compile binaries
- source for samba-3.6.9 and winexe-1.00

Just run the installer and you should be good to go! If not email me....jbrav.hax@gmail.com
- Run option #1 to compile binaries before you do anything!
*** If there are no binaries...the program will not work***
Sounds simple enough
